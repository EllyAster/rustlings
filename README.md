# 🦀 My Rustlings Journey

This repository contains **my personal solutions and notes** from working through the [Rustlings](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org/) 

> These files represent my progress and reflections as I learn the Rust programming language step by step.

## 📘 About Rustlings

[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) is an open-source project by the Rust community. It offers small exercises that teach you Rust syntax, ownership, borrowing, traits, lifetimes, and more 

You can think of it as an interactive Rust tutorial where each error message is part of the learning process.
